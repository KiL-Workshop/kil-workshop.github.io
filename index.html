      <p>This workshop seeks to expedite efforts at the intersection of Symbolic Knowledge and Statistical Knowledge inherent in LLMs. The objective is to establish quantifiable methods and acceptable metrics for addressing consistency, reliability, and safety in LLMs. Simultaneously, we seek unimodal or multimodal NeuroSymbolic solutions to mitigate LLM issues through context-aware explanations and reasoning. The workshop also focuses on critical applications of LLMs in health informatics, biomedical informatics, crisis informatics, cyber-physical systems, and legal domains. We invite submissions that present novel developments and assessments of informatics methods, including those that showcase the strengths and weaknesses of utilizing LLMs.
